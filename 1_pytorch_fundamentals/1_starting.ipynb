    "# Deep Learning with Pytorch\n",
    "##### By Md. Rishat Talukder\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pytorch` is the successor of `Torch` which is an open-source machine learning library based on the `Torch` library. It is used for applications such as `natural language processing(LLM)`, `computer vision`, `audio processing`, etc. It is primarily developed by `Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pytorch` is a `deep learning framework` that provides a flexible and dynamic computational graph. It is a `Python-based scientific computing package` that uses the power of `GPUs`. It is also one of the preferred deep learning research platforms built to provide flexibility as a deep learning research platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have prior knowledge of `Deep Learning` and `Neural Networks` you should have heard the name of `Tensorflow` which is another popular deep learning framework. The main difference between `Pytorch` and `Tensorflow` is that `Pytorch` uses dynamic computation graphs while `Tensorflow` uses static computation graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But both are widely populer in their own way. In this article series, we will learn about `Pytorch` and how to use it for `Deep Learning`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm `Md. Rishat Talukder` and I will be your instructor in this article series. I'm a `softwere/backend developer` and `AI enthusiast`. I have a good amount of experience in `Deep Learning` and `Neural Networks`. I have worked on various projects using `Pytorch` and `Tensorflow`. I'm also a `content creator` and I have a `Youtube channel` where I make coding tutorials and share my knowledge with others. You can follow me on my social media platforms to stay updated with my latest works.\n",

    "I'll make part by part small articles on `Deep Learning with Pytorch` where I'll cover all the things I learned and experienced in my `Deep Learning` journey. So, let's get started with our first part.\n",

    "# Pytorch Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing pytorch is very easy. You can install it using `pip`. You can install it using the following command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "pip install torch torchvision torchaudio\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can install it through the official website of `Pytorch`. You can visit the official website of `Pytorch` and install it according to your system configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pytorch Official Website](https://pytorch.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you have successfully installed `Pytorch` you can start using it. SO, we can start by importing the `torch` library.\n"
