    "##### By Md. Rishat Talukder\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pytorch` is the successor of `Torch` which is an open-source machine learning library based on the `Torch` library. It is used for applications such as `natural language processing(LLM)`, `computer vision`, `audio processing`, etc. It is primarily developed by `Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pytorch` is a `deep learning framework` that provides a flexible and dynamic computational graph. It is a `Python-based scientific computing package` that uses the power of `GPUs`. It is also one of the preferred deep learning research platforms built to provide flexibility as a deep learning research platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have prior knowledge of `Deep Learning` and `Neural Networks` you should have heard the name of `Tensorflow` which is another popular deep learning framework. The main difference between `Pytorch` and `Tensorflow` is that `Pytorch` uses dynamic computation graphs while `Tensorflow` uses static computation graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But both are widely populer in their own way. In this article series, we will learn about `Pytorch` and how to use it for `Deep Learning`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm `Md. Rishat Talukder` and I will be your instructor in this article series. I'm a `softwere/backend developer` and `AI enthusiast`. I have a good amount of experience in `Deep Learning` and `Neural Networks`. I have worked on various projects using `Pytorch` and `Tensorflow`. I'm also a `content creator` and I have a `Youtube channel` where I make coding tutorials and share my knowledge with others. You can follow me on my social media platforms to stay updated with my latest works.\n",
