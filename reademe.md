# This is everything I know of pytorch

In this `repository` I have jupyter notebook file where I have documented everything I learned about pytorch. I have also included the dataset I used in the notebook.


> important note: My pc have a APU which cannot be used for training with pytorch. SO, probably you wont find any info on how to use the GPU for training.
